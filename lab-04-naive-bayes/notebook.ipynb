    "well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows – at\n",
    "least not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other\n",
    "believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.\"\n",
    "He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some.\n",
    "\"I'm sorry,\" said Harry, \"I still don't really understand.\"\n",

    "Brothers' . . . I have a copy somewhere . . .\"\n",
    "He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but\n",
    "Hermione said, \"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here.\"\n",
    "And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag.\n",
    "\"The original?\" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said,\n",
    "\"Well then, why don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all\n",
    "understand.\"\n",
    "\"Er. . . all right,\" said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw\n",
    "that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little\n",
    "cough, and began to read.\n",
    "\"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road\n",
    "at twilight –'\"\n",
    "\"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron, who had stretched out, arms\n",
    "behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance.\n",
    "\"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!\" said Ron.\n",
    "\"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\" said Harry before he\n",
    "could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was\n",
    "staring out of the window at the sky. \"Go on, Hermione.\"\n",
    "\"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too\n",
    "dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and\n",
    "so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous\n",
    "water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded\n",
    "figure.\n",
    "\"'And Death spoke to them –'\"\n",
    "\"Sorry,\" interjected Harry, \"but Death spoke to them?\"\n",
    "\"It's a fairy tale, Harry!\"\n",
    "\"Right, sorry. Go on.\"\n",
    "\"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the\n",
    "three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He\n",
    "pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had\n",
    "earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him.\n",
    "\"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more\n",
    "powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand\n",
    "worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the\n",
    "banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the\n",
    "oldest brother.\n",
    "\"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to\n",
    "humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So\n",
    "\n",
    "Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told\n",
    "him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead.\n",
    "\"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The\n",
    "youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not\n",
    "trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place\n",
    "without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own\n",
    "Cloak of Invisibility.'\"\n",
    "\"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again.\n",
    "\"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at\n",
    "them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.\"\n",
    "\"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way,\n",
    "and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's\n",
    "gifts.\n",
    "\"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination.\n",
    "\"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village,\n",
    "sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand\n",
    "as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead\n",
    "upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the\n",
    "powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-\n",
    "sodden upon his bed. The thief took the wand and for good measure, slit the oldest\n",
    "\n",
    "brother's throat.\n",
    "\"'And so Death took the first brother for his own.\n",
    "\"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone.\n",
    "Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in\n",
    "his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to\n",
    "marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.\n",
    "\"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had\n",
    "returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the\n",
    "second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her.\n",
    "\"'And so Death took the second brother from his own.\n",
    "\"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never\n",
    "able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother\n",
    "finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death\n",
    "as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'\"\n",
    "Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to\n",
    "realize that she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and\n",
    "said: \"Well, there you are.\"\n",
    "\"Sorry?\" said Hermione, sounding confused.\n",
    "\"Those are the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius.\n",
    "He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of\n",
    "parchment from between more books.\n",
    "\"The Elder Wand,\" he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment.\n",
    "\"The Resurrection Stone,\" he said, and added a circle on top of the line. \"The Cloak of\n",
    "Invisibility,\" he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols\n",
    "that so intrigued Hermione. \"Together,\" he said, \"the Deathly Hallows.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story,\" said\n",
    "Hermione.\n",
    "\"Well, of course not,\" said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \"That is a children's\n",
    "tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters,\n",
    "however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if\n",
    "united, will make the possessor master of Death.\"\n",
    "There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window.\n",
    "Already the sun was low in the sky.\n",
    "\"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\" he said quietly.\n",
    "\"When you say 'master of Death' –\"said Ron.\n",
    "\"Master,\" said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \"Conqueror. Vanquisher.\n",
    "Whichever term you prefer.\"\n",
    "\"But then . . . do you mean . . .\" said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that\n",
    "she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, \"that you believe these\n",
    "objects – these Hallows – really exist?\"\n",
    "Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again.\n",
    "\"Well, of course.\"\n",
    "\"But,\" said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, \"Mr.\n",
    "Lovegood, how can you possibly believe – ?\"\n",
    "\"Luna has told me all about you, young lady,\" said Xenophilius. \"You are, I\n",
    "gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.\"\n",
    "\"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,\" said Ron, nodding toward the\n",
    "ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing.\n",
    "\"Mr. Lovegood,\" Hermione began again, \"We all know that there are such things\n",
    "as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But –\"\n",
    "\"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to\n",
    "say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a\n",
    "Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but\n",
    "fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly\n",
    "renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and\n",
    "impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have\n",
    "you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?\"\n",
    "Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more\n",
    "confused than ever. She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they\n",
    "were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one\n",
    "Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment.\n",
    "\"Exactly,\" said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument.\n",
    "\"None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich,\n",
    "would he not?\"\n",
    "He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest\n",
    "trace of pink.\n",
    "\"All right,\" said Hermione, disconcerted. \"Say the Cloak existed. . . what about\n",
    "that stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?\"\n",
    "\"What of it?\"\n",
    "\"Well, how can that be real?\"\n",
    "\"Prove that is not,\" said Xenophilius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hermione looked outraged.\n",
    "\"But that's – I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove\n",
    "it doesn't exist? Do you expect me to get hold of – of all the pebbles in the world and test\n",
    "them? I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is\n",
    "that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!\"\n",
    "\"Yes, you could,\" said Xenophilius. \"I am glad to see that you are opening your\n",
    "mind a little.\"\n",
    "\"So the Elder Wand,\" said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \"you\n",
    "think that exists too?\"\n",
    "\"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\" said Xenophilius. \"The Elder\n",
    "Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from\n",
    "hand to hand.\"\n",
    "\"Which is what?\" asked Harry.\n",
    "\"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner,\n",
    "if he is to be truly master of it,\" said Xenophilius. \"Surely you have heard of the way the\n",
    "wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how\n",
    "Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the\n",
    "dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The\n",
    "bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.\"\n",
    "Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not\n",
    "contradict him.\n",
    "\"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\" asked Ron.\n",
    "\"Alas, who knows?\" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \"Who\n",
    "knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius.\n",
    "Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who\n",
    "can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\"\n",
    "There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \"Mr. Lovegood, does the\n",
    "Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\"\n",
    "Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he\n",
    "could not locate it. Peverell. . . he had heard that name before. . .\n",
    "\"But you have been misleading me, young woman!\" said Xenophilius, now sitting\n",
    "up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \"I thought you were new to the\n",
    "Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything –\n",
    "everything! – to do with the Hallows!\"\n",
    "\"Who are the Peverells?\" asked Ron.\n",
    "\"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow,\" said\n",
    "Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \"Ignotus Peverell.\"\n",
    "\"Exactly!\" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \"The sign of the\n",
    "Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!\"\n",
    "\"Of what?\" asked Ron.\n",
    "\"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers,\n",
    "Antioch, Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\"\n",
    "With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and\n",
    "headed for the spiral staircase.\n",
    "\"You will stay for dinner?\" he called, as he vanished downstairs again.\n",
    "\"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's,\" said Ron under his\n",
    "breath.\n",
    "Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen\n",
    "downstairs before speaking.\n",
    "\"What do you think?\" he asked Hermione.\n",
    "\"Oh, Harry,\" she said wearily, \"it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the\n",
    "sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\"\n",
    "\"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\" said Ron.\n",
    "\"You didn't believe it either?\" Harry asked him.\n",
    "\"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't\n",
    "it? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff\n",
    "that's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be\n",
    "okay. Come to think of it,\" Ron added, \"maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed\n",
    "to be unlucky.\"\n",
    "\"What are you talking about?\"\n",
    "\"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx\n",
    "by twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard\n",
    "them. My mum's full of them.\"\n",
    "\"Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\" Hermione reminded him. \"We were taught\n",
    "different superstitions.\" She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the\n",
    "kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed\n",
    "to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \"I think you're right,\" she told him.\n",
    "\"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose –\"\n",
    "The three of them spoke at the same time: Hermione said, \"the Cloak,\" Ron said,\n",
    "\"the wand,\" and Harry said, \"the stone.\"\n",
    "They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused.\n",
    "\"You're supposed to say the Cloak,\" Ron told Hermione, \"but you wouldn't need\n",
    "to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\"\n",
    "\"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, \"And it's helped us rather a lot, in\n",
    "case you hadn't noticed!\" said Hermione. \"Whereas the wand would be bound to attract\n",
    "trouble--\"\n",
    "\"Only if you shouted about it,\" argued Ron. \"Only if you were prat enough to go dancing\n",
    "around waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and\n",
    "have a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut --\"\n",
    "-Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?\" said Hermione, looking skeptical. \"You know\n",
    "the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful\n",
    "wands for hundreds of years.\"\n",
    "\"There have?\" asked Harry.\n",
    "Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and\n",
    "Ron grinned at each other.\n",
    "\"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the\n",
    "centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them.\n",
    "Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -- oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as\n",
    "powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are\n",
    "bigger and better than other people's\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But how do you know,\" said Harry, \"that those wants -- the Deathstick, and the Wand of\n",
    "Destiny -- aren't the same want, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\"\n",
    "\"What if they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\" said Ron.\n",
    "Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was after all, ridiculous. His\n",
    "wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by\n",
    "Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies\n",
    "and if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?\n",
    "\"So why would you take the stone?\" Ron asked him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius...Mad-\n",
    "Eye...Dumbledore...my parents...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled.\n",
    "\"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?\" said\n",
    "Harry, thinking about the tail they had just heard. \"I don't suppose there have been loads\n",
    "of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?: he asked Hermione.\n",
    "\"No,\" she replied sadly. \"I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves\n",
    "that's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know,\n",
    "instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\"\n",
    "The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning\n",
    "underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever\n",
    "Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings.\n",
    "\"What about the Cloak, though?\" said Ron slowly. \"Don't you realize, he's right? I've got\n",
    "so used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of\n",
    "one like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it --\"\n",
    "\"Of course not -- we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!\"\n",
    "\"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know,\n",
    "is true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off\n",
    "cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes,\n",
    "Harry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!\"\n",
    "\"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...\"\n",
    "As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching\n",
    "the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once.\n",
    "His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a\n",
    "moment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he\n",
    "began to clime the stairs.\n",
    "\"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!\"\n",
    "But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling\n",
    "with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They\n",
    "were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about\n",
    "them all the same. Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be a fine golden chains\n",
    "wove around the pictures linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or\n",
    "so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one work repeated a thousand times in\n",
    "golden ink: friends... friends... friends...\n",
    "Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a\n",
    "large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her.\n",
    "They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had\n",
    "ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared\n",
    "\n",
    "around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with dust. There were\n",
    "no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look,\n",
    "as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest\n",
    "window across the blood red sky.\n",
    "\"What's wrong?\" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could\n",
    "respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray\n",
    "laden with bowls.\n",
    "\"Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry. \"Where's Luna?\"\n",
    "\"Excuse me?\"\n",
    "\"Where's Luna?\"\n",
    "Xenophilius halted on the top step.\n",
    "\"I -- I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies.\"\n",
    "\"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\"\n",
    "Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued\n",
    "chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands\n",
    "shook.\n",
    "\"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks.\" said Harry. \"Her clothes are gone, her bed\n",
    "hasn't been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?\"\n",
    "Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed Harry, Ron, and\n",
    "Hermione drew their wands. Xenophilius froze his hand about to enter his pocket. At that\n",
    "moment the printing press have a huge bank and numerous Quibblers came streaming\n",
    "across the floor from underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. Hermione\n",
    "stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr.\n",
    "Lovegood.\n",
    "\"Harry, look at this\" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter.\n",
    "The front of the Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words\n",
    "\"Undesirable Number One\" and captioned with the reward money.\n",
    "\"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?: Harry asked coldly, his mind working very\n",
    "fast. \"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood?\n",
    "Sending an owl to the Ministry?\n",
    "Xenophilius licked his lips\n",
    "\"They took my Luna,\" he whispered, \"Because of what I've been writing. They took my\n",
    "Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her\n",
    "back to me if I -- If I--\"\n",
    "\"Hand over Harry?\" Hermione finished for him.\n",
    "\"No deal.\" said Ron flatly. \"Get out of the way, we're leaving.\"\n",
    "Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer.\n",
    "\"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not\n",
    "leave.\"\n",
    "He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother\n",
    "doing the same thing in front of his crib.\n",
    "\"Don't make us hurt you,\" Harry said. \"Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\"\n",
    "\"HARRY!\" Hermione screamed.\n",
    "Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away\n",
    "from him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He\n",
    "launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as\n",
    "\n",
    "Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.\n",
    "There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart.\n",
    "Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an\n",
    "impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the\n",
    "floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard\n",
    "Hermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him\n",
    "that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs.\n",
    "Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust.\n",
    "Half of the ceiling had fall in and the end of Luna's bead was hanging through the hole.\n",
    "The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing fragments of\n",
    "torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side,\n",
    "blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by,\n",
    "and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed his finger to her lips.\n",
    "The door downstairs crashed open.\n",
    "\"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell\n",
    "you this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from\n",
    "Xenophilius.\n",
    "\"No...no...upstairs...Potter!\"\n",
    "\"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some\n",
    "solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for\n",
    "that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" -- Another bang, another squeal --\n",
    "\"When you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple\" -- Bang\n",
    "-- \"Headed\"--bang--\"Snorkacks?\"\n",
    "\"No -- no -- I beg of you!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"It really is Potter, Really!\"\n",
    "\"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death\n",
    "Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from\n",
    "Xenophilius.\n",
    "\"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up\n",
    "the mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might\n",
    "bring the place down.\"\n",
    "\"You lying piece of filth.\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn.\n",
    "\"You have never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us,\n",
    "did you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\"\n",
    "\"I swear...I swear...Potter's upstairs!\"\n",
    "\"Homenum revelio.\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp,\n",
    "and he had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body\n",
    "in its shadow.\n",
    "\"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply.\n",
    "\"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please...please...give me Luna,\n",
    "just let me have Luna...\"\n",
    "\"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and\n",
    "bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice\n",
    "waiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to\n",
    "bury.\"\n",
    "Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings.\n",
    "Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\"\n",
    "He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the\n",
    "staircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they\n",
    "could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off\n",
    "his legs. While Xenophilius banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione\n",
    "managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm.\n",
    "\"All right.\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs\n",
    "begin to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust.\n",
    "\"Do you trust me Harry?\"\n",
    "Harry nodded.\n",
    "\"Okay then.\" Hermione whispered. \"give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to\n",
    "put it on.\"\n",
    "\"Me? But Harry --\"\n",
    "\"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder.\"\n",
    "Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking\n",
    "the stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry\n",
    "did not know what Hermione was waiting for.\n",
    "\"Hold tight\" she whispered. \"Hold tight...any second...\"\n",
    "Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard.\n",
    "\"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath\n",
    "them. \"Deprimo!\"\n",
    "She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still\n",
    "holding onto her hand for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two\n",
    "men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained\n",
    "all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of\n",
    "the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have\n",
    "landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around\n",
    "them, waving her wand.\n",
    "“Protego Totalum...Salvio Hexia...”\n",
    "“That treacherous old bleeder.” Ron panted, emerging from beneath the\n",
    "Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. “Hermione you’re a genius, a total genius. I\n",
    "can’t believe we got out of that.”\n",
    "“Cave Inimicum...Didn’t I say it was an Frumpent horn, didn’t I tell him? And\n",
    "now his house has been blown apart!”\n",
    "“Serves him right,” said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs,\n",
    "“What’d you reckon they’ll do to him?”\n",
    "“Oh I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione, “That’s why I wanted the\n",
    "Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn’t\n",
    "been lying!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Why hide me though?” asked Ron.\n",
    "“You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They’ve kidnapped Luna\n",
    "because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew\n",
    "you’re with him?”\n",
    "“But what about your mum and dad?”\n",
    "“They’re in Australia,” said Hermione, “They should be all right. They don’t\n",
    "know anything.”\n",
    "“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed.\n",
    "Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t know what we’d do\n",
    "without you.”\n",
    "She beamed, but became solemn at once.\n",
    "“What about Luna?”\n",
    "“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still Alive ---“ began Ron.\n",
    "“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be alive, she must!”\n",
    "“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she survives the place,\n",
    "though...Loads don’t...”\n",
    "“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. “She’s\n",
    "tough, Luna, much tougher than you’d think. She’s probably teaching all the inmates\n",
    "about Wrackspurts and Nargles.”\n",
    "“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. “I’d feel\n",
    "so sorry for Xenophilius if ---“\n",
    "“---if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,” said Ron.\n",
    "They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their\n",
    "narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly.\n",
    "“Oh, why did we go there?” groaned Hermione after a few minutes’ silence.\n",
    "“Harry, you were right, it was Godric’s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time!\n",
    "The Deathly Hallows...such rubbish...although actually,” a sudden thought seemed to\n",
    "have struck her, “he might have made it all up, mightn’t he? He probably doesn’t believe\n",
    "in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters\n",
    "arrived!”\n",
    "“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when\n",
    "you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It\n",
    "was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a\n",
    "whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we\n",
    "stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us\n",
    "talking.”\n",
    "“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if he was being\n",
    "honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.”\n",
    "“Hang on, though,” said Ron. “The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a\n",
    "myth, wasn’t it?”\n",
    "“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!”\n",
    "“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron. “Harry’s Invisibility\n",
    "Cloak ---“\n",
    "“The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione firmly. “A story about\n",
    "how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the\n",
    "Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,” said Harry, turning the\n",
    "blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.\n",
    "“There’s no such thing, Harry!”\n",
    "“You said there have been loads of wands --- the Deathstick and whatever they\n",
    "were called ---“\n",
    "“All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the\n",
    "Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her\n",
    "tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!”\n",
    "“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad\n",
    "appear...and Cedric...”\n",
    "“But they weren’t really back from the dead, were they?” said Hermione. “Those\n",
    "kind of ---of pale imitations aren’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.”\n",
    "“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that\n",
    "once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see\n",
    "her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while...”\n",
    "He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s expression.\n",
    "Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his\n",
    "talk of living with dead people.\n",
    "“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said hastily, trying\n",
    "to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything about him, then?”\n",
    "“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I looked him up\n",
    "after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important,\n",
    "I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name\n",
    "‘Peverell’ Is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,”\n",
    "she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. “It lists the pure-blood families that are now\n",
    "extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to\n",
    "vanish.”\n",
    "“Extinct in the male line?” repeated Ron.\n",
    "“It means the name died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in the case of the\n",
    "Peverells. They could still have descendents, though, they’d just be called something\n",
    "different.”\n",
    "And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the\n",
    "sound of the name “Peverell”: a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a\n",
    "Ministry official, and he cried aloud, “Marvolo Gaunt!”\n",
    "“Sorry said Ron and Hermione together.\n",
    "“Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With\n",
    "Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”\n",
    "Ron and Hermione looked bewildered.\n",
    "“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the\n",
    "Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry’s face, he\n",
    "nearly shoved it up his nose!”\n",
    "“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you see what it\n",
    "looked like?”\n",
    "“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing fancy on there,\n",
    "as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had\n",
    "been cracked open.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron\n",
    "was looking from one to the other, astonished.\n",
    "“Blimey...You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows?\n",
    "“Why not said Harry excitedly, “Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived\n",
    "like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through\n",
    "the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that\n",
    "house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He’d have loved to\n",
    "think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned,\n",
    "having pure blood made you practically royal.”\n",
    "“Yes...and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously, “but Harry, if\n",
    "you’re thinking what I think you’re think ---“\n",
    "“Well, why not? Why not? said Harry, abandoning caution. “It was a stone,\n",
    "wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it was the Resurrection Stone?”\n",
    "Ron’s mouth fell open.\n",
    "“Blimey --- but would it still work if Dumbledore broke --- ?”\n",
    "“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection\n",
    "Stone!”\n",
    "Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. Harry you’re trying to\n",
    "fit everything into the Hallows story ---“\n",
    "“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the\n",
    "sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the\n",
    "Peverells!”\n",
    "“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!”\n",
    "“Where’d you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What did Dumbledore\n",
    "do with it after he broke it open?”\n",
    "“But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione’s...\n",
    "Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of\n",
    "Death...Master...Conqueror...Vanquisher...The last enemy that shall be destroyed is\n",
    "death...\n",
    "And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose\n",
    "Horcruxes were no match...Neither can live while the other survives...Was this the\n",
    "answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the\n",
    "one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe?\n",
    "“Harry?”\n",
    "But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was\n",
    "running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen\n",
    "anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was\n",
    "exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer\n",
    "completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable\n",
    "concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it...\n",
    "And then, with a gasp, he remembered—\n",
    "“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!”\n",
    "His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care.\n",
    "“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He\n",
    "wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is\n",
    "buried in Godric’s Hollow...” Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as\n",
    "\n",
    "though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. “He’s my ancestor. I’m\n",
    "descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!”\n",
    "“He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of\n",
    "possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the\n",
    "other two.\n",
    "“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his\n",
    "neck, his fingers shaking hard.\n",
    "“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand. “Read it!\n",
    "Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a\n",
    "Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself\n",
    "completely invisible without one!”\n",
    "Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged\n",
    "the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly\n",
    "tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder\n",
    "erupted inside him so that he shouted out.\n",
    "“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring – it’s in the Snitch!”\n",
    "“You --- you reckon?”\n",
    "He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear\n",
    "to Harry. Everything fit, everything...His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he\n",
    "discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to\n",
    "do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then ---\n",
    "But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope\n",
    "and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the\n",
    "glorious spell was broken.\n",
    "“That’s what he’s after.”\n",
    "The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared.\n",
    "“You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.”\n",
    "He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth.\n",
    "It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a\n",
    "very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and\n",
    "Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking...\n",
    "Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him\n",
    "The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them.\n",
    "Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew\n",
    "about them?\n",
    "Harry gazed into the darkness...If Voldemort had known about the Deathly\n",
    "Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects\n",
    "that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he\n",
    "might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t the simple fact that he had\n",
    "taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last\n",
    "great Wizarding secret?\n",
    "Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full\n",
    "power, without understanding that it was one of three...for the wand was the Hallow that\n",
    "could not be hidden, whose existence was best known...The bloody trail of the Elder\n",
    "Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history...\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the\n",
    "face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries.\n",
    "He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing\n",
    "exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her side\n",
    "looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few\n",
    "minutes?\n",
    "“This is it?” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own\n",
    "astonished certainty, “This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I’ve\n",
    "got one --- maybe two ---“\n",
    "He held up the Snitch.\n",
    "“--- and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t realize...he just\n",
    "thinks it’s a powerful wand ---“\n",
    "“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily’s letter,\n",
    "“I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all wrong.”\n",
    "“But don’t you see? It all fits ---“\n",
    "“Not, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t. Harry, you’re just getting carried away.\n",
    "Please,” she said as she started to speak, “please just answer me this: If the Deathly\n",
    "Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who\n",
    "possessed all of them would be master of Death --- Harry, why wouldn’t he have told\n",
    "you? Why?”\n",
    "He had his answer ready.\n",
    "“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them for yourself! It’s a\n",
    "Quest!”\n",
    "“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods’!” cried\n",
    "Hermione in exasperation. “I didn’t really believe it!”\n",
    "Harry took no notice.\n",
    "“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength,\n",
    "take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.”\n",
    "“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing, and\n",
    "Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That\n",
    "symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get\n",
    "sidetracked ---“\n",
    "Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his\n",
    "hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to\n",
    "Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.\n",
    "She appealed to Ron.\n",
    "“You don’t believe in this, do you?”\n",
    "Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.\n",
    "“I dunno...I mean...bits of it sort of fit together,” said Ron awkwardly, “But\n",
    "when you look at the whole thing...” He took a deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to\n",
    "get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe...maybe we\n",
    "should forget about this Hallows business.”\n",
    "“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first watch.”\n",
    "And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to\n",
    "a fierce full stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken\n",
    "possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his\n",
    "mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all...\n",
    "I open at the close...But what was the close? Why couldn’t he have the stone\n",
    "now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person...and\n",
    "Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even\n",
    "Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open...\n",
    "And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort\n",
    "searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort’s thoughts,\n",
    "because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same\n",
    "thing...Hermione would not like that idea, of course...But then, she did not\n",
    "believe....Xenophilius had been right, in a way...Limited, Narrow, Close-minded. The\n",
    "truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the\n",
    "Resurrection Stone...and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly\n",
    "swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield...\n",
    "It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban,\n",
    "surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all\n",
    "about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but\n",
    "dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about\n",
    "it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand...He must try that in the\n",
    "morning...\n",
    "If only there was a way of getting a better wand...\n",
    "And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed\n",
    "him once more...\n",
    "They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of\n",
    "rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and\n",
    "persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and\n",
    "depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had\n",
    "been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts,\n",
    "could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the\n",
    "less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference\n",
    "was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his\n",
    "certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows\n",
    "consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with\n",
    "the Horcruxes.\n",
    "“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless\n",
    "enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of\n",
    "interest in locating more Horcruxes. “We’re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We’re\n",
    "the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!”\n",
    "But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the\n",
    "Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left\n",
    "the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other\n",
    "survives...master of Death...Why didn’t Ron and Hermione understand?\n",
    "“’The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,’” Harry quoted calmly.\n",
    "“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?” Hermione\n",
    "retorted, and Harry gave up on her.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing,\n",
    "seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing\n",
    "that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he\n",
    "could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but\n",
    "was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had\n",
    "changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and\n",
    "out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that\n",
    "looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance.\n",
    "Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried\n",
    "that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that\n",
    "he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected\n",
    "these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the\n",
    "blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort’s mind as well as\n",
    "before.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-\n",
    "absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to\n",
    "\n",
    "make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into\n",
    "listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now\n",
    "encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.\n",
    "“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of action, come on!\n",
    "Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage...”\n",
    "Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every\n",
    "place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and\n",
    "Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him.\n",
    "He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to\n",
    "find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more\n",
    "unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving.\n",
    "“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley is a Wizarding\n",
    "village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.”\n",
    "These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional\n",
    "sight of Snatchers.\n",
    "“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,” said Ron. “The lot that\n",
    "got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said\n",
    "on Potterwatch ---“\n",
    "“On what?” said Harry.\n",
    "“Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The program I keep\n",
    "trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what’s going on! Nearly\n",
    "all of the programs are following You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch, I really\n",
    "want you to hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in...”\n",
    "Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on\n",
    "top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of\n",
    "advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot,\n",
    "Strong Love.” While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password,\n",
    "muttering strings of random words under his breath.\n",
    "“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them. “Bill had a real\n",
    "knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in the end...”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent\n",
    "entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their\n",
    "way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent.\n",
    "“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry.”\n",
    "Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows,\n",
    "Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside\n",
    "the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for\n",
    "something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a\n",
    "most familiar voice was issuing.\n",
    "“...apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a\n",
    "number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.”\n",
    "“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione.\n",
    "“I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?”\n",
    "“...now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was saying, and I’m\n",
    "pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening.\n",
    "Evening, boys!”\n",
    "“Hi.”\n",
    "“Evening, River.”\n",
    "“’River’” that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names, but you can\n",
    "usually tell ---“\n",
    "“Shh!” said Hermione.\n",
    "“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s take a\n",
    "moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily\n",
    "Prophet don’t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform\n",
    "our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.”\n",
    "Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one\n",
    "another in horror.\n",
    "“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born\n",
    "Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks,\n",
    "Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any\n",
    "knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news.\n",
    "“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their\n",
    "home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the\n",
    "Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse --- more evidence, as if it\n",
    "were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational\n",
    "sport under the new regime.\n",
    "“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot\n",
    "have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months\n",
    "ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of\n",
    "injuries inflicted by Dark Magic.\n",
    "“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of\n",
    "Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less\n",
    "regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.”\n",
    "Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned\n",
    "to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had\n",
    "felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we can return to regular contributor\n",
    "Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.”\n",
    "“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring.\n",
    "“Kingsley!” burst out Ron.\n",
    "“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him.\n",
    "“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to\n",
    "sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However, we continue to hear truly\n",
    "inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle\n",
    "friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our\n",
    "listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any\n",
    "Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are\n",
    "taken.”\n",
    "“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these\n",
    "dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’? asked Lee.\n",
    "“I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods first,’ and then\n",
    "to ‘Death Eaters,’” replied Kingsley. “We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is\n",
    "worth the same, and worth saving.”\n",
    "“Excellently put, Royal, and you’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever\n",
    "get out of this mess,” said Lee. “And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals\n",
    "of Potter.’”\n",
    "“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but\n",
    "Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.\n",
    "“We know it’s Lupin!”\n",
    "“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve appeared on our\n",
    "program, that Harry Potter is still alive?”\n",
    "“I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death\n",
    "would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened,\n",
    "because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime.\n",
    "‘The Boy Who Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the\n",
    "triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.”\n",
    "A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him,\n",
    "then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met?\n",
    "“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?”\n",
    "“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesitated slightly,\n",
    "“And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.”\n",
    "Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.\n",
    "“Nearly always right,” she repeated.\n",
    "“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s living with\n",
    "Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big too...”\n",
    "“...and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter’s who are suffering for\n",
    "their allegiance?” Lee was saying.\n",
    "“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of\n",
    "Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile\n",
    "editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin.\n",
    "“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid” – all three of\n",
    "them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -- “well-known gamekeeper at\n",
    "Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he\n",
    "is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ party in his house. However, Hagrid\n",
    "was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve got a sixteen-\n",
    "foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May I just add that\n",
    "while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge even the most\n",
    "devoted of Harry’s supporters against following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’\n",
    "parties are unwise in the present climate.”\n",
    "“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you continue to show\n",
    "your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now\n",
    "let’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter.\n",
    "We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of\n",
    "the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new correspondent.\n",
    "Rodent?”\n",
    "“’Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried\n",
    "out together:\n",
    "“Fred!”\n",
    "“No – is it George?”\n",
    "“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said,\n",
    "“I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be ‘Rapier’!”\n",
    "“Oh, all right then, ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take on the various\n",
    "stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?”\n",
    "“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know, unless they’ve taken\n",
    "refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy\n",
    "of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the\n",
    "alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos\n",
    "running around the place.”\n",
    "“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery is creating more\n",
    "terror than actually showing himself.”\n",
    "“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad\n",
    "enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who\n",
    "can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple\n",
    "test: Check whether the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look\n",
    "into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still likely to be the last thing\n",
    "you ever do.”\n",
    "For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the\n",
    "weight of tension leaving him.\n",
    "“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked Lee.\n",
    "“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he’s been\n",
    "putting in?” asked Fred. “Point is, people, don’t get lulled into a false sense of security,\n",
    "thinking he’s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can\n",
    "move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don’t\n",
    "\n",
    "count on him being a long way away if you’re planning to take any risks. I never thought\n",
    "I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!”\n",
    "“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee. ”Listeners, that\n",
    "brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t know when it will be possible to\n",
    "broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The\n",
    "next password will be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.”\n",
    "The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry,\n",
    "Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an\n",
    "extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten\n",
    "that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.\n",
    "“Good, eh?” said Ron happily.\n",
    "“Brilliant,” said Harry.\n",
    "“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they were found ...”\n",
    "“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.”\n",
    "“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was\n",
    "over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. “He’s abroad! He’s\n",
    "still looking for the Wand, I knew it!”\n",
    "“Harry—“\n",
    "“Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol –“\n",
    "“HARRY, NO!”\n",
    "“—demort’s after the Elder Wand!”\n",
    "“The name’s Taboo!” Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded\n",
    "outside the tent. “I told you, Harry, I told you, we can’t say it anymore – we’ve got to put\n",
    "the protection back around us – quickly – it’s how they find –“\n",
    "But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had\n",
    "lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited\n",
    "voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out.\n",
    "“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the\n",
    "darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and\n",
    "we don’t care who we curse!”\n",
    "\n",
    "He was flying facedown on the grond again. The smell of the forest filled his nostrils. He\n",
    "could feel\n",
    "the cold hard ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses which have been\n",
    "knocked sideways\n",
    "by the fall cutting into his temple. Every inch of him ached, and the place where Killing\n",
    "Curse had hit him\n",
    "felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but he remained exactly where\n",
    "he had fallen, with\n",
    "his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth gaping.\n",
    "He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead\n",
    "hurried footsteps,\n",
    "whispers, and solicitous murmurs filled the air.\n",
    "\"My Lord... my Lord...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his\n",
    "eyes, but allowed\n",
    "his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed\n",
    "beneath his robes because\n",
    "he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight cushioning effect in\n",
    "the area of his stomach\n",
    "told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight.\n",
    "\"My Lord...\"\n",
    "\"That will do,\" said Voldemort's voice.\n",
    "More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate\n",
    "to see what was\n",
    "happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter.\n",
    "Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying\n",
    "away from him,\n",
    "returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling\n",
    "beside Voldemort.\n",
    "Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters\n",
    "have been buddled\n",
    "around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened\n",
    "when he had hit Harry with\n",
    "the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both of them had\n",
    "briefly fallen unconcious\n",
    "and both of them had now returned. . .\n",
    "\"My Lord, let me --\"\n",
    "\"I do not require assitance,\" said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it,\n",
    "Harry pictured\n",
    "Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. \"The boy . . . Is he dead?\"\n",
    "There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he\n",
    "felt their concentraded\n",
    "gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an\n",
    "eyelid might twitch.\n",
    "\"You,\" said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain.\n",
    "\"Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.\"\n",
    "Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his\n",
    "heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be\n",
    "examined, but at the same time nothing, small comfort through it was, that Voldemort\n",
    "was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort\n",
    "suspected that all had not gone to plan . . . .\n",
    "Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart.\n",
    "He could hear the woman's fast breathing,\n",
    "her pounding of life against his ribs.\n",
    "\"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?\"\n",
    "The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his car, her head bent\n",
    "so low that her long hair shielded his face\n",
    "from the onlookers.\n",
    "\"Yes,\" he breathed back.\n",
    "\n",
    "He felt the hand on his chest contract: her nails pierced him. Then it was\n",
    "withdrawn. She had sat up.\n",
    "\"He is dead!\" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.\n",
    "And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and\n",
    "through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red\n",
    "and silver light shoot into the air in celebration.\n",
    "Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only\n",
    "way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts,\n",
    "and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared whether\n",
    "Voldemort won.\n",
    "\"You see?\" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. \"Harry Potter is dead by my\n",
    "hand, and no man alive can threaten me now!\n",
    "Watch! Crucio!\"\n",
    "Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain\n",
    "unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected\n",
    "to humiliation to prove Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his\n",
    "determination to remain limp, yet the pain he\n",
    "expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses\n",
    "flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath\n",
    "his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when he fell no ground for the last\n",
    "time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks\n",
    "of laughter.\n",
    "\"Now,\" said Voldemort, \"we go to the castle, and show them what has become of\n",
    "their hero. Who shall drag the body? No - Wait - \"\n",
    "There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the\n",
    "ground trembling beneath him.\n",
    "\"You carry him,\" Voldemort said. \"He will be nice and visible in your arms, will\n",
    "he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the\n",
    "glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable - \"\n",
    "Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but\n",
    "the enormous hands that lifted him into the air\n",
    "were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms trembling with the force of his\n",
    "heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him\n",
    "as Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to\n",
    "intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost.\n",
    "\"Move,\" said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through\n",
    "the close-growing trees, back through the forest.\n",
    "Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his mouth lolling open,\n",
    "his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the\n",
    "Death Eaters croed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to\n",
    "see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of\n",
    "Harry Potter. . . .\n",
    "The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees\n",
    "creaking and falling as they passed; they made so\n",
    "much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of the Death Eaters\n",
    "were drowned. The victorious procession marched\n",
    "\n",
    "on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the\n",
    "darkness through his closed eyelids, that the trees\n",
    "were beginning to thin.\n",
    "\"BANE!\"\n",
    "Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. \"Happy now, are\n",
    "yeh, that yeh didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags?\n",
    "Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead . . . ?\"\n",
    "Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how\n",
    "many centaurs were watching their procession pass;\n",
    "he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called insults at the centaurs\n",
    "as they left them behind. A little later, Harry\n",
    "sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest.\n",
    "\"Stop.\"\n",
    "Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command,\n",
    "because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled\n",
    "over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that\n",
    "patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now.\n",
    "The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his\n",
    "father's stag kept guardian in his heart.\n",
    "Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself\n",
    "because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically\n",
    "magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon Harry's eardrums.\n",
    "\"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while\n",
    "you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his\n",
    "body as proof that your hero is gone.\n",
    "\"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters\n",
    "outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must\n",
    "be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman or child, will be\n",
    "slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the\n",
    "castle now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your\n",
    "brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will\n",
    "join me in the new world we shall build togheter.\"\n",
    "There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to\n",
    "him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.\n",
    "\"Come,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was\n",
    "forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw\n",
    "Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great snake Nagini around his shoulders,\n",
    "now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility\n",
    "of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death\n",
    "Eaters, who marched on the either side of them through the\n",
    "slowly lightening darkness . . . .\n",
    "\"Harry,\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .\"\n",
    "Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle\n",
    "and strained his ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices\n",
    "of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs of life from those within.\n",
    "\"Stop.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Death Eaters camte to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing\n",
    "the opne front doors of the school. He could see, even\n",
    "though his closed lids, the teddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the\n",
    "entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom\n",
    "he had tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms.\n",
    "\"NO!\"\n",
    "The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that\n",
    "Professor McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard\n",
    "another women laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix gloried in McGonagall's despair.\n",
    "He squinted again for a single second and saw the open\n",
    "doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps\n",
    "to face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for\n",
    "themselves. He saw Voldemort standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head\n",
    "with a single white finger. He closed his eyes again.\n",
    "\"No!\"\n",
    "\"No!\"\n",
    "\"Harry! HARRY!\"\n",
    "Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry\n",
    "wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made himself lie\n",
    "silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of survivors took up the cause,\n",
    "screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until -\n",
    "\"SILENCE!\" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light,\n",
    "and silence was forced upn them all. \"It is over! Set him down,\n",
    "Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!\"\n",
    "Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.\n",
    "\"You see? said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward\n",
    "right beside the place where he lay. \"Harry Potter is dead! Do you\n",
    "understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to\n",
    "sacrifice themselves for him!\"\n",
    "\"He beat you!\" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts\n",
    "were shouting and screaming again until a second, more\n",
    "powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.\n",
    "\"He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,\" said Voldemort,\n",
    "and there was a relish in his voice for the lie. \"killed while trying\n",
    "to save himself - \"\n",
    "But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a\n",
    "flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal\n",
    "amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the\n",
    "figure hit the ground. Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger's\n",
    "wand aside and laughing.\n",
    "\"And who is this?\" he said in his soft snake's hiss. \"Who has volunteered to\n",
    "demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the\n",
    "battle is lost?\"\n",
    "Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.\n",
    "\"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so\n",
    "much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was\n",
    "struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the\n",
    "no-man's-land between the survivors and the Death Eaters. \"But you are a pureblood,\n",
    "aren't you, my brave boy? Voldemort asked Neville, who stood facing him,\n",
    "his empty hands curled in fists.\n",
    "\"So what if I am?\" said Neville loudly.\n",
    "\"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very\n",
    "valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom.\"\n",
    "\"I'll join you when hell freezes over,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore's Army!\" he\n",
    "shouted, and there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom\n",
    "Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.\n",
    "\"Very well,\" said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his\n",
    "voice than in the most powerful curse. \"If that is your choice, Longbottom,\n",
    "we revert to the original plan. On your head,\" he said quietly, \"be it.\"\n",
    "Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds\n",
    "later, out of one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a\n",
    "misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the\n",
    "mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled, emtpy and ragged: the Sorting Hat.\n",
    "\"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,\" said Voldemort. \"There will\n",
    "be no more Houses. The emblem, sheild and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar\n",
    "Slythering, will suffice everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?\"\n",
    "He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto\n",
    "Neville's head, so thta it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the\n",
    "watching crowd in front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands,\n",
    "holding the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.\n",
    "\"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish\n",
    "enough to continue to oppose me,\" said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he\n",
    "caused the Sorting Hat to burst into flames.\n",
    "Screams split the dawn, and Neville was a flame, rooted to the spot, unable to\n",
    "move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act -\n",
    "And then many things happened at the same moment.\n",
    "They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like\n",
    "hundreds of people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the\n",
    "castle, uttering lowd war cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side\n",
    "of the castel and yelled, \"HAGGER!\" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's\n",
    "giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves\n",
    "and the twangs of bows, and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who\n",
    "broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his\n",
    "robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville moved too.\n",
    "In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him;\n",
    "the flaming har fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a\n",
    "glittering, rubied handle -\n",
    "The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming\n",
    "crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of te stampending centaurs, and yet, it\n",
    "seemd to draw every eye. With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head,\n",
    "which spun high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and\n",
    "\n",
    "Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's\n",
    "body thudded to the ground at his feet-\n",
    "Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville\n",
    "and Voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell\n",
    "came loudets of all.\n",
    "\"HARRY!\" Hagrid shouted. \"HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?\"\n",
    "Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone\n",
    "was feeling the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements\n",
    "that had come from who knew where; Harry saw great winget creatues soaring the heads\n",
    "of Voldemort's giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes\n",
    "while Grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts\n",
    "and Death Eaters alike were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes\n",
    "and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who\n",
    "had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd. Still hidden beneath\n",
    "the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffered into the entrance hall: He was searching for\n",
    "Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into\n",
    "the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left\n",
    "and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims. Seamus\n",
    "Finnigan and Hannah Abbott, datted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the\n",
    "fight already flourishing inside it.\n",
    "And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and\n",
    "Harry saw Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral\n",
    "pijamas. They seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and\n",
    "friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps\n",
    "and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the\n",
    "hall with a great clatter of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was\n",
    "blasted off its hinges.\n",
    "The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed intot he entrance hall, screaming and\n",
    "waving carving knives and cleaver, and at their head, the locker of Regulus Black\n",
    "bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din:\n",
    "\"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the\n",
    "name of brave Regulus! Fight!\"\n",
    "They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of Death Eaters their tiny\n",
    "faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under\n",
    "sheer weight of numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in\n",
    "the leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming\n",
    "horde.\n",
    "But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past atruggling prosoners,\n",
    "and into he Great Hall.\n",
    "Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting al\n",
    "within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible,\n",
    "and the Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced\n",
    "their way inside.\n",
    "Harry saw Yaxley slammed tot he floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov\n",
    "fall with a scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by\n",
    "Hagrid, hit the stone wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and\n",
    "\n",
    "Neville bringing down Fenrir Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and\n",
    "Percy flooting Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd,\n",
    "not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son.\n",
    "Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and\n",
    "there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish\n",
    "him -\n",
    "Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her\n",
    "master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but\n",
    "Bellatrix was equal to them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so\n",
    "close to Ginny that she missed death by an inch -\n",
    "He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had\n",
    "gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.\n",
    "\"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\"\n",
    "Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on\n",
    "the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger.\n",
    "\"OUT OF MY WAY!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple\n",
    "swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly\n",
    "Weasley's wand slashed and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became\n",
    "a snarl. Jets of light flew from both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became bot\n",
    "and cracked; both woman were fighting to kill.\n",
    "\"No!\" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid.\n",
    "\"Get back! Get back! She is mine!\"\n",
    "Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and\n",
    "his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both,\n",
    "wanting to attack and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent.\n",
    "\"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?\" taunted Bellatrix, as\n",
    "mad as her master, capering as Molly's curses danced around her. \"When Mummy's gone\n",
    "the same way as Freddie?\"\n",
    "\"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley.\n",
    "Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he\n",
    "toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen\n",
    "before it did.\n",
    "Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's constreched arm and hit her squarely in\n",
    "the chest, directly over her heart.\n",

    "completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and began, at the same moment,\n",
    "to circle each other.\n",
    "\"I don't want anyone else to help,\" Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his\n",
    "voice carried like a trumpet call. \"It's got to be like this. It's got to be me.\"\n",

    "\"One of us?\" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes\n",
    "stared, a snake that was about to strike. \"You think it will be you, do you, the boy who\n",
    "has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?\"\n",
    "\"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?\" asked Harry. They were\n",
    "still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance\n",
    "from each other, and for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. \"Accident, when I\n",
    "decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still\n",
    "survived, and returned to fight again?\"\n",
    "\"Accidents!\" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching\n",
    "crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to\n",
    "breathe but they two. \"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled\n",
    "behind the skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!\"\n",
    "\"You won't be killing anyone else tonight,\" said Harry as they circled, and stared\n",
    "into each other's eyes, green into red. \"You won't be able to kill any of them ever again.\n",
    "Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - \"\n",

    "solution, love, which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling\n",
    "from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me\n",

    "\"Just one thing,\" said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each\n",
    "other, held apart by nothing but the last secret.\n",
    "\"If it is not love that will save you this time,\" said Voldemort, \"you must believe\n",
    "that you have magic that i do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I believe both,\" said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face,\n",
    "though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more\n",
    "frightening than his screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall.\n",
    "\"You think you know more magic than I do?\" he said. \"Than I, than Lord\n",
    "Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?\"\n",
    "\"Oh he dreamed of it,\" said Harry, \"but he knew more than you, knew enough not\n",
    "to do what you've done.\"\n",
    "\"You mean he was weak!\" screamed Voldemort. \"Too weak to dare, too weak to\n",

    "\"You thought you did,\" said Harry, \"but you were wrong.\"\n",
    "For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the\n",

    "'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before \n",
    "the break of day?' \n",
    "\n",
    "'I don't know,' answered Frodo. 'I fear those Black Riders, and I am \n",
    "sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which \n",
    "it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should \n",
    "very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed \n",
    "when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two \n",
    "things. Flow soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could \n",
    "we \n",
    "\n",
    "get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'The answer to the second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get \n",
    "off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies \n",
    "in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for \n",
    "a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But \n",
    "what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?' \n",
    "\n",
    "'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found \n",
    "you here,' answered Merry. 'They could have reached here by now, of course, \n",
    "if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the \n",
    "river -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they \n",
    "would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message \n",
    "through to the Master of the Hall - for they would not like the look of the \n",
    "Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland \n",
    "cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the \n",
    "morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be \n",
    "let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live \n",
    "at Crickhollow.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Frodo sat for a while in thought. 'I have made up my mind,' he said \n",
    "finally. 'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going \n",
    "by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the \n",
    "North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of \n",
    "being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, \n",
    "the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, \n",
    "whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don't know how many there \n",
    "are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is \n",
    "to go off in a quite unexpected direction.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!' said Fredegar \n",
    "horrified. 'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as \n",
    "Black Riders.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo \n",
    "is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "With luck we might gel a considerable start.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No \n",
    "one ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh yes they do!' said Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in - occasionally \n",
    "when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, \n",
    "long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when \n",
    "the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Well, do as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of the \n",
    "Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a \n",
    "nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, \n",
    "nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from \n",
    "Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was \n",
    "to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as \n",
    "possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He \n",
    "had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo's to help him in playing \n",
    "the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Excellent!' said Frodo, when he understood the plan. ’We could not \n",
    "have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don't know whether \n",
    "these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk \n",
    "a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty \n",
    "is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we \n",
    "have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing \n",
    "tomorrow.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our \n",

    "\n",
    "When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. \n",
    "\n",
    "His legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually \n",
    "he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high \n",
    "window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there \n",
    "was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would \n",
    "smell him out sooner or later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a \n",
    "great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was \n",
    "not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in \n",
    "waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he \n",
    "was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, \n",
    "and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him \n",
    "a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over \n",
    "him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge \n",
    "towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a \n",
    "noise of thunder. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Ah! The Ring! ' said Boromir, his eyes lighting. 'The Ring! Is it not \n",
    "a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a \n",
    "thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the House \n",
    "of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? ' \n",
    "\n",
    "Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange \n",
    "gleam in Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind and friendly. 'It is \n",
    "best that it should lie hidden,' he answered. \n",
    "\n",
    "'As you wish. I care not,' said Boromir. 'Yet may I not even speak of \n",
    "it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: \n",
    "of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas \n",
    "Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were \n",
    "with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us? ' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Were you not at the Council? ' answered Frodo. 'Because we cannot use \n",
    "it, and what is done with it turns to evil.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. 'So you go on,' he cried. \n",
    "'Gandalf, Elrond — all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves \n",
    "they may be right. These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come \n",
    "to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. \n",
    "\n",
    "But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We \n",
    "of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not \n",
    "desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves, \n",
    "strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the \n",
    "-Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad \n",
    "not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the \n",
    "ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in \n",
    "this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would \n",
    "drive the \n",
    "\n",
    "hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!' \n",
    "\n",
    "Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed \n",
    "to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the \n",
    "mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious \n",
    "victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, \n",
    "benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms. \n",
    "\n",
    "'And they tell us to throw it away!' he cried. 'I do not say destroy \n",
    "it. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does \n",
    "not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk \n",
    "blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for \n",
    "himself. Folly! \n",
    "\n",
    "'Surely you see it, my friend?' he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo \n",
    "again. 'You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon \n",
    "you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?' \n",
    "\n",
    "'No, I am afraid,' said Frodo. 'Simply afraid. But I am glad to have \n",
    "heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Then you will come to Minas Tirith? ' cried Boromir. His eyes were \n",
    "shining and his face eager. \n",
    "\n",
    "'You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo. \n",
    "\n",
    "'But you will come, at least for a while? ' Boromir persisted. 'My city \n",
    "is not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than from \n",
    "here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the \n",
    "Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,' he said. \n",
    "'You \n",
    "\n",
    "need rest before your venture, if go you must.’ He laid his hand on the \n",
    "hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling \n",
    "with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the \n",
    "tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Why are you so unfriendly? ’ said Boromir. 'I am a true man, neither \n",
    "thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my \n",
    "word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make \n",
    "trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! ’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'No! no! ' cried Frodo. 'The Council laid it upon me to bear it.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,’ cried Boromir. \n",
    "\n",
    "'How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "mining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of \n",
    "N®menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might \n",
    "have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me ! ' \n",
    "\n",
    "Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood \n",
    "between them. 'Come, come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why \n",
    "not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the \n",
    "blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by \n",
    "force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he \n",
    "sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was \n",
    "hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only \n",
    "one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and \n",
    "quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The \n",
    "Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking \n",
    "here and there among the rocks and trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Miserable trickster!' he shouted. 'Let me get my hands on you! Now I \n",
    "see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have \n",
    "only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all \n",
    "halflings to death and darkness ! ' Then, catching his foot on a stone, he \n",
    "fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his \n",
    "own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. \n",
    "\n",
    "He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. \n",
    "\n",
    "'What have I said? ' he cried. 'What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called. \n",
    "'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! ' \n",
    "\n",
    "There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already \n",
    "far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief \n",
    "shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his \n",
    "burning eyes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping \n",
    "for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty \n",
    "flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set \n",
    "upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that \n",
    "had clambered upon the throne of mountain -kings. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in \n",
    "which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there \n",
    "the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright \n",
    "living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was \n",
    "sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men \n",
    "of N®menor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, \n",
    "and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a \n",
    "ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken \n",
    "teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, \n",
    "the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below \n",
    "his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over \n",
    "the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the \n",
    "fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of \n",
    "sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green \n",
    "and silver sea, rippling in endless lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains \n",
    "were crawling like anthills: ores were issuing out of a thousand holes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and \n",
    "fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; \n",
    "smoke rose on the borders of Lurien. \n",
    "\n",
    "Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from \n",
    "Isengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of \n",
    "the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon \n",
    "horses, \n",
    "\n",
    "chariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was \n",
    "in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it \n",
    "seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many -towered, proud and fair upon its \n",
    "mountain- seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were \n",
    "bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith \n",
    "was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, \n",
    "unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the \n",
    "grinning gates of Minas Morgul. and the haunted Mountains, and it looked \n",
    "upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay \n",
    "there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, \n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, \n",
    "battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron, \n",
    "gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dyr, Fortress of Sauron. \n",
    "\n",
    "All hope left him. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that \n",
    "did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager \n",
    "will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, \n",
    "searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where \n",
    "he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself \n",
    "from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood. \n",
    "\n",
    "He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I \n",
    "come to you ? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of \n",
    "power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off! \n",
    "\n",
    "Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring! \n",
    "\n",
    "The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between \n",
    "their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware of \n",
    "himself again. Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and \n",
    "with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his \n",
    "finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black \n",
    "shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and \n",
    "groped \n",
    "\n",
    "out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in \n",
    "every tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was \n",
    "firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. T will do now what I \n",
    "must,' he said. This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at \n",
    "work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more \n",
    "harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too \n",
    "dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart \n",
    "yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen \n",
    "into evil. I will go alone. At once.' \n",
    "\n",
    "He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir \n",
    "had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and \n",
    "calls from the woods near the shore below. \n",
    "\n",
    "'They'll be hunting for me,' he said. T wonder how long I have been \n",
    "away. Hours, I should think.' He hesitated. 'What can I do? ' he muttered. \n",
    "\n",
    "'I must go now or I shall never go. I shan't get a chance again. I hate \n",
    "leaving them, and like this without any explanation. But surely they will \n",
    "understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?' \n",
    "\n",
    "Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and \n",
    "passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The others remained long by the river -side. For some time they had been \n",
    "silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and \n",
    "they were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other \n",
    "things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn \n",
    "concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of \n",
    "its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land of the \n",
    "Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great \n",
    "Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words \n",
    "strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why \n",
    "was \n",
    "\n",
    "he hesitating? \n",
    "\n",
    "'He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,’ said \n",
    "Aragorn. 'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company \n",
    "to go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum, and must fear that the \n",
    "secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to \n",
    "the Fire and the destruction of the Burden. \n",
    "\n",
    "'We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord \n",
    "Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond \n",
    "his power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might \n",
    "of the Enemy when he comes to take it. Which way would any of us choose in \n",
    "Frodo’s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "’Grievous is our loss,’ said Legolas. ’Yet we must needs make up our \n",
    "minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call \n",
    "him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'And so should I,’ said Gimli. ’We, of course, were only sent to help \n",
    "the Bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us \n",
    "is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting \n",
    "from \n",
    "\n",
    "Lothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the \n",
    "last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose \n",
    "Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'And I too will go with him,’ said Legolas. 'It would be faithless now \n",
    "to say farewell.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "’It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,’ said Aragorn. ’But \n",
    "if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all \n",
    "should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, \n",
    "or one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself. \n",
    "Boromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need \n",
    "him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, \n",
    "if Legolas is not willing to leave us.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'That won’t do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and \n",
    "I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not \n",
    "realize what that would mean. It seemed different so far away, in the Shire \n",
    "or in Ri vendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why \n",
    "can't we stop him?' \n",
    "\n",
    "'We must stop him,' said Pippin. 'And that is what he is worrying \n",
    "about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree to his going east. And he doesn't \n",
    "like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to \n",
    "Mordor alone! ' Pippin shuddered. 'But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought \n",
    "to know that he hasn't got to ask. He ought to know that if we can't stop \n",
    "him, we shan't leave him.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Begging your pardon,' said Sam. 'I don't think you understand my \n",
    "master at all. He isn't hesitating about which way to go. Of course not! \n",
    "What's the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your \n",
    "pardon, \n",
    "\n",
    "Master Boromir,' he added, and turned. It was then that they discovered that \n",
    "Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, \n",
    "was no longer there. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Now where's he got to? ' cried Sam, looking worried. 'He's been a bit \n",
    "queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he's not in this business. He's off to \n",
    "his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows \n",
    "he's got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can. But he's afraid. Now it's \n",
    "come to the point, he's just plain terrified. That's what his trouble is. Of \n",
    "course he's had a bit of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left \n",
    "home, or he'd be so terrified he'd just fling the Ring in the River and \n",
    "bolt. But he's still too frightened to start. And he isn't worrying about us \n",
    "either: whether we'll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's \n",
    "another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he'll \n",
    "want to go alone. Mark my words! We're going to have trouble when he \n",
    "comes \n",
    "\n",
    "back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,' said Aragorn. \n",
    "'And what shall we do, if you prove right? ’ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Stop him! Don't let him go! ' cried Pippin. \n",
    "\n",
    "'I wonder? ' said Aragorn. 'He is the Bearer, and the fate of the \n",
    "Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or \n",
    "the other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are \n",
    "other powers at work far stronger.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Well, I wish Frodo would \"screw himself up\" and come back, and let us \n",
    "get it over,' said Pippin. 'This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up? \n",
    "\n",
    "f \n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes,' said Aragorn. 'The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing \n",
    "away. We must call for him.' \n",
    "\n",
    "At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and \n",
    "walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim and sad. He \n",
    "paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with \n",
    "his eyes on the ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Where have you been, Boromir? ’ asked Aragorn. 'Have you seen Frodo? ’ \n",
    "\n",
    "Boromir hesitated for a second. 'Yes, and no,’ he answered slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to \n",
    "come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He \n",
    "vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before, though I have heard \n",
    "of it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I \n",
    "thought he would return to you.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Is that all that you have to say? ' said Aragorn, looking hard and not \n",
    "too kindly at Boromir. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes,' he answered. 'I will say no more yet.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'This is bad!' cried Sam, jumping up. 'I don't know what this Man has \n",
    "been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn't ought to have; \n",
    "and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!' \n",
    "\n",
    "'But he wouldn't keep it on' 1 said Merry. 'Not when he had escaped the \n",
    "unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'But where did he go? Where is he? ' cried Pippin. 'He's been away ages \n",
    "now.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Half an hour, maybe,' he answered. 'Or it might be an hour. I have \n",
    "wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know! ' He put his \n",
    "head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief. \n",
    "\n",
    "'An hour since he vanished! ' shouted Sam. 'We must try and find him at \n",
    "once. Come on! ’ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Wait a moment! ' cried Aragorn. 'We must divide up into pairs, and \n",
    "arrange-here, hold on! Wait! ' \n",
    "\n",
    "It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. \n",
    "Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into \n",
    "the trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo ! in their clear, high \n",
    "hobbit- voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness \n",
    "seemed to have fallen on the Company. \n",
    "\n",
    "'We shall all be scattered and lost,’ groaned Aragorn. 'Boromir! I do \n",
    "not know what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after \n",
    "those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot \n",
    "find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I \n",
    "shall return soon.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he \n",
    "reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, \n",
    "panting and calling, Frodo! \n",
    "\n",
    "'Come with me, Sam! ’ he said. 'None of us should be alone. There is \n",
    "mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen, \n",
    "to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went \n",
    "this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' He sped up the path. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and \n",
    "soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead. \n",
    "Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Whoa, Sam Gamgee! ’ he said aloud. 'Your legs are too short, so use \n",
    "your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; but he \n",
    "hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed \n",
    "himself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where \n",
    "to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel \n",
    "hard.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. 'Steady, \n",
    "Gamgee! ' he said. 'Think, if you can! He can't fly across rivers, and he \n",
    "can't jump waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's got to get back to the \n",
    "boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning! ' \n",
    "\n",
    "Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up \n",
    "he got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the \n",
    "shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there. \n",
    "There seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He \n",
    "stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "bank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat \n",
    "slipped into the wat \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "128d \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "er. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! ' called Sam, and flung himself from the \n",
    "bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry \n",
    "and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went \n",
    "under, and the River closed over his curly head. \n",
    "\n",
    "An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and \n",
    "the boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he \n",
    "came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Up you come, Sam my lad! ’ said Frodo. 'Now take my hand! ' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Save me, Mr. Frodo! ’ gasped Sam. 'I'm drownded. I can’t see your \n",
    "hand.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Here it is. Don't pinch, lad! I won’t let you go. Tread water and \n",
    "don’t flounder, or you'll upset the boat. There now, get hold of the side, \n",
    "and let me use the paddle! ' \n",
    "\n",
    "With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was \n",
    "able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and \n",
    "stepped ashore again. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! ’ he said. \n",
    "\n",
    "’Oh, Mr. Frodo, that’s hard! ’ said Sam shivering. 'That’s hard, trying \n",
    "to go without me and all. If I hadn’t a guessed right, where would you be \n",
    "now? ’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Safely on my way.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Safely! ’ said Sam. 'All alone and without me to help you? I couldn’t \n",
    "have a borne it, it’d have been the death of me.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "’It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,’ said Frodo and I \n",
    "could not have borne that.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Not as certain as being left behind,’ said Sam. \n",
    "\n",
    "'But I am going to Mordor.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I’m coming \n",
    "with you.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Now, Sam,’ said Frodo, 'don’t hinder me! The others will be coming \n",
    "back at any minute. If they catch me here. I shall have to argue and \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I \n",
    "must go at once. It's the only way.’ \n",
    "\n",
    "'Of course it is,' answered Sam. 'But not alone. I'm coming too, or \n",
    "neither of us isn’t going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. \n",
    "'Leave one! 'he said. 'We'll need it. But you can't come like this without \n",
    "your gear or food or anything.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Just hold on a moment, and I'll get my stuff!' cried Sam eagerly. \n",
    "\n",
    "'It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.' He rushed to the camping \n",
    "place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he \n",
    "emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some \n",
    "extra packages of food, and ran back. \n",
    "\n",
    "'So all my plan is spoilt! ’ said Frodo. 'It is no good trying to \n",
    "escape you. But I’m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is \n",
    "plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find \n",
    "a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them \n",
    "again.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam. \n",
    "\n",
    "So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo \n",
    "paddled away from the shore, and the River bore them swiftly away, down the \n",
    "western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir. The roar of the \n",
    "great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was hard \n",
    "work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive \n",
    "the boat eastward towards the far shore. \n",
    "\n",
    "At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon \n",
    "Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high \n",
    "above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would \n",
    "bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of \n",

    "Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had\n",
    "developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket; This\n",
    "particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by\n",
    "studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept\n",
    "flashing on and off.\n",
    "“Will you stop it!” she cried on the third evening of Kreacher’s absence, as all the\n",
    "light was sucked from the drawing room yet again.\n",
    "“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. “I\n",
    "don’t know I’m doing it!”\n",
    "“Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?”\n",
    "“What, like reading kids’ stories?”\n",
    "“Dumbledore left me this book, Ron –”\n",
    "“—and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to use it!”\n",
    "Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either\n",
    "of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was\n",
    "sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of\n",
    "stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the\n",
    "grinding of the chain.\n",
    "Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the\n",
    "shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a\n",
    "glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed\n",
    "the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice asked, “Severus\n",
    "Snape?” Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its\n",
    "dead hand.\n",
    "“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice.\n",
    "The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make\n",
    "out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind.\n",
    "Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it.\n",
    "“Don’t move!”\n",
    "He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains\n",
    "hiding her flew open and she began to scream, “Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my\n",
    "house –”\n",
    "Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing,\n",
    "like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.\n",
    "“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!”\n",
    "“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black\n",
    "instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his\n",
    "wand, but Harry did not.\n",
    "“Show yourself!” he called back.\n",
    "Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of\n",
    "surrender.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four\n",
    "creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I\n",
    "taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.”\n",
    "“Oh, all right,” said Harry, lowering his wand, “but I had to check, didn’t I?”\n",
    "“Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that\n",
    "you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t be so quick to lower your defenses.”\n",
    "They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak,\n",
    "he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.\n",
    "“No sign of Severus, then?” he asked.\n",
    "“No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?’\n",
    "“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple of Death\n",
    "Eaters in the square outside –”\n",
    "“We know –”\n",
    "“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be\n",
    "sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have\n",
    "more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you,\n",
    "Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened\n",
    "after you left the Burrow.”\n",
    "They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate.\n",
    "A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and\n",
    "glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his\n",
    "traveling cloak and they sat down.\n",
    "“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater\n",
    "tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here after the wedding?”\n",
    "“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on\n",
    "Tottenham Court Road.”\n",
    "Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.\n",
    "“What?”\n",
    "They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast.\n",
    "“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who\n",
    "Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.”\n",
    "“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road\n",
    "at the time, does it?” said Harry.\n",
    "“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could still have the\n",
    "Trace on him?”\n",
    "“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved.\n",
    "“Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace\n",
    "on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham\n",
    "Court Road, that’s worrying, really worrying.”\n",
    "He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait.\n",
    "“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing since Ron’s dad\n",
    "told us the family was safe.”\n",
    "“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most of the\n",
    "wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.”\n",
    "“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected Hermione.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now,” said\n",
    "Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry.\n",
    "Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before\n",
    "they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”\n",
    "Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock\n",
    "and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was\n",
    "true, the man’s final act had been to try to protect Harry.\n",
    "“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lupin went on.\n",
    "“They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close – and then they interrogated those\n",
    "of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of\n",
    "course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.\n",
    "“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters\n",
    "were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,” he\n",

    "“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full\n",
    "might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin. “They’ve got the power to perform\n",
    "brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every\n",
